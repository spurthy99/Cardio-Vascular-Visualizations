# Cardio-Vascular-Visualizations

![alt text](https://github.com/spurthy99/Cardio-Vascular-Visualizations/blob/main/Images/Dashboard.png)

The Dashboard contains all the visualizations that we made. This Dashboard can be used by doctors to plan the treatment based on the analysis done by the visualizations. Scientists can use this for research and development purposes. They can explore and relate many health factors. Also, nutritionists can use this dashboard to create a balanced diet plan for the consultants who approach them based on their health conditions, and age factors.



The Dataset
The Dataset we selected was personal indicators of heart disease. We got this dataset from Kaggle. We selected this dataset because heart disease has become one of the most common diseases and all age groups of people are suffering from this. Also, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least one of the three primary risk factors for heart disease is present in half of the Americans that are almost 47 percent. Also, Heart disease is also one of the leading causes of mortality in the United States.
High blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity (high BMI), insufficient physical exercise, and excessive alcohol use are all risk factors. In healthcare, detecting and avoiding the causes that have the greatest influence on heart disease is essential. As a result of computational advancements, machine learning methods may be used to find "patterns" in data that can be used to forecast a patient's status.

Other data Scientists that used data for:
This dataset may be used to test a variety of machine learning techniques, the most common of which are classifier models like logistic regression, SVM, random forest, etc. However, the classes are not balanced, hence the traditional model application strategy is not recommended. Fixing the weights or under-sampling should improve the findings. Also, there is an app built using a logistic regression model based on this dataset and is present in https://heart-condition-checker.herokuapp.com/.  
The data originated with the CDC and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which conducts yearly telephone surveys to collect information on Americans' health. Data from 2020 is included in the most recent dataset as of today. 
Number of Rows and Columns:
There are 401,958 rows and 18 columns in it. There are 9 Boolean columns, 5 text format columns, and 4 decimal format columns. There were many factors (columns) that directly or indirectly influence heart disease in this dataset, so we decided to pick the most key factors (Columns) and clean them up so they could be used in machine learning applications. 

Dataset attributes and Column data types:
•	Heart Disease: Defines the value of the respondents having heart disease. Heart Disease is a Categorial data type attribute. It has the values like yes or no only. 
•	BMI: Body Mass Index values of respondents in decimal format from 12 to 94.8. BMI is the ratio data type attribute. 
•	Smoking: The value is based on the answers yes or no given by respondents to questions like have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes or 5 cigarette packets in your entire life? Smoking is the categorical data type attribute. 
•	Stroke: The stroke column is filled with values like yes or no for the question was hit by a stroke ever in their life? The stroke is the categorical data type attribute.
•	Alcohol Drinking: The respondents are asked if they are Heavy drinkers (adult men having more than 14 drinks per week and adult women having more than 7 drinks per week. The responses are recorded as yes or no. Alcohol drinking in categorical attribute.
•	Physical health: About the respondent's physical health including physical illness and injury, for how many days during the past months did they suffered is considered and the input is taken in decimal points up to 30.0. Hence, Physical health is a ratio data type attribute.
•	Mental Health: This has the values given by respondents about their mental health, gauging the decimal value up to 30.0 for how many days during the past month (about 4 and a half weeks) was your mental health not good? Mental health is a ratio data type attribute.
•	General Health: The respondents are asked if their general health is either good or very good. General health is a categorical data type attribute.
•	Sex: The values are either male or female. It is a categorical data type attribute.
•	Race: The values like white, Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaskan Native are recorded from respondents. The race is categorial data type attributes.
•	Age Category: The age category is a ratio data type attribute. The age of respondents was recorded if female or male.
•	Diabetic: The respondents were asked the question if they had diabetics or not. The response was recorded in yes, no, borderline diabetics format. Diabetics is a categorical value. 
•	Physical Activity: The answers from respondents were recorded in yes or no format. It is recorded yes if the adults reported they do physical activity or exercise during the past month other than their regular job, otherwise, it is no. Physical attribute is a categorical attribute.
•	Sleep Time: The sleep hours of the respondents are recorded on an average for about 24 hours. The values are recorded in the decimal format of 1 to 24 hours. Sleep time is a ratio data type attribute.
•	Asthma: The values of yes or no were recorded after asking if they ever had asthma or not. Asthma is a categorical data type attribute.
•	Kidney Disease: Based on the yes or no answers of the respondent that if they had any kidney diseases such as kidney stones, bladder infection, or incontinence. Kidney disease is the categorical data type attribute.
•	Skin Cancer: Respondents were asked if they ever had skin cancer. The values were recorded in yes or no format. Skin cancer is a categorical data type.
•	Different Walking: The respondent's answers were recorded to questions like do they have serious difficulty in walking or climbing stairs? The values are taken in yes or no format. The Different walking column is a categorical data type attribute. 

#What can be visualized using this dataset:
 	We can use this dataset for different visualizations and gain important information. Some examples are: 
•	We can find out who is more prone for heart disease
•	Which age grouped people need to take precautions from getting heart disease.
•	Effects of all habits like drinking, smoking, sleepless nights, no exercise and bad mental health can be visualized.

#Section 3: Dashboard Users##
 The Heart Disease dataset is helpful to a variety of professionals related to the medical field. Exploring and visualizing the dataset will help advancement in research and hopefully advance the clinical diagnosis and early detection and treatment of heart diseases.
The prospective users of our dashboard include:
•	Doctors: The doctors can use the dataset to plan the course of treatment, when the patient has been admitted to the hospital based on his history. Considering factors like diabetes, kidney disease and physical health is important to reach a conclusion.
•	Scientists: scientists can use it for research and development to predict/analysis the reason/likeliness of a heart disease. The relation between various health factors can also be explored using the dashboard.
•	Nutritionists: Depending on their health conditions, people will have varying restrictions when it comes to diet. A nutritionist can customize the dietary options available for heart patients based on various parameters.
