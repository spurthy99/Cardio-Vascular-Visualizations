The Dashboard contains all the visualizations that we made. This Dashboard can be used by doctors to plan the treatment based on the analysis done by the visualizations. Scientists can use this for research and development purposes. They can explore and relate many health factors. Also, nutritionists can use this dashboard to create a balanced diet plan for the consultants who approach them based on their health conditions, and age factors.

Explore and play around with the dashboard here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/spurthy.mutturaj2661/viz/HeartDiseaseProject_17064851457340/Dashboard1
